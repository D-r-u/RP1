# Enhancing Fault Tolerance in Wireless Mesh Networks

This project implements the adaptive and resilient routing algorithms from the paper *“Enhancing Fault Tolerance in Wireless Mesh Networks through Adaptive and Resilient Routing Protocols”* using NS-3.42 (C++) for simulation and Python (ML) for post-analysis.

## Components
- Adaptive Routing (ACO-based)
- Resilient Topology Control
- Dynamic Fault Detection
- SVM-based Predictive Fault Tolerance

Results and performance plots are stored in `data/metrics.csv`.
