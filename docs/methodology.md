# Methodology Overview

This document describes the methodology for enhancing fault tolerance in Wireless Mesh Networks using:
1. Dynamic Fault Detection
2. Adaptive Routing (ACO-based)
3. Resilient Topology Control
4. Machine Learning Integration (SVM)

Each phase is simulated in NS-3, with telemetry collected and fed into a predictive SVM model.
The results are analyzed based on latency, throughput, PDR, and network lifetime.
